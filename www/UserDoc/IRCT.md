# IRCT

## What is the IRCT?
One of the stated goals of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative is to harvest the wealth of information contained in Big Data to advance our knowledge of human health and disease. As part of this initiative the Harvard University Medical School (HMS) Department of Biomedical Informatics Patient-Centered Informatics Common: Standard Unification of Research Elements (PIC-SURE) is developing an open-source infrastructure that will foster the incorporation of multiple heterogeneous patient level clinical, omic, and environmental datasets. This system embraces the idea of decentralized repositories (resources) of varying types, and protocols. It provides a single simple secure communication interface that can perform queries, joins, and computations across different resources. To implement this we created the BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API called the IRCT (Inter Resource Communication Tool) which provides a resource agnostic service through which multiple resources of varying types, and protocols can be accessed. Users communicate with this service using a series of Representative State Transfer (RESTful) calls.

## What can the IRCT do?
The easiest way to understand what the IRCT is by explaining what it isn’t. First and foremost it is not an attempt at a universal API. It is not going to be the one API, or protocol that all biomedical application should implement. It does not require existing resource to change their protocol. It does not define an ontology, or prefer one type of ontology over another. And it does not restrict the where, or how data is stored.

The core idea behind the IRCT is that no API, protocol, ontology, or application is going to be a perfect fit for all biomedical research. However being able to combine data across different resources will provide a powerful tool for researches. The IRCT accomplishes this by allows different resources to be defined – by initial configuration -  what they are, what they have, and what they can do. It can support existing resources without requiring them to make any changes, and allows new resources to be quickly integrated. This is accomplished by creating a ‘Resource Driven API’.

## What is a Resource Driven API?
All actions that can be performed by resources from the IRCT are abstracted into a set of definitions. These definitions provide basic information such as what predicates are supported, and can be executed on a resource. Since the IRCT doesn’t restrict what actions, and commands can be performed individual resources can define any number of predicate operators, data types, parameters, and. This model is flexible enough to support several different resource types, but still rigid enough to allow users to quickly create and execute different actions with the IRCT

## IRCT Components Overview

The IRCT consists of four components; Communication Layer (IRCT-CL), API (IRCT-API), Extensions (IRCT-EXT), and Resource Interfaces (IRCT-RI). Each component performs a specific task so that a query, or any other action can be successfully accomplished.

The IRCT Communication Layer (IRCT-CL) provides a secure resource agnostic REpresentative State Transfer (RESTful) service. Users build queries by making a series of calls to the RESTful service that can span multiple datasets and resources. These queries, and other actions are passed onto the IRCT-API. The IRCT Application Programming Interface (IRCT-API) is the core of the IRCT project. It manages the queries for data, and processing across the different resources. Beyond just this it ensures that all the actions that are attempted by the end user are valid, manages the available resources, and provides some basic security. The IRCT Extension (IRCT-EXT) provides a way of adding additional functionality to an IRCT instance. Administrators can add any number of additional features without having to make code changes, or recompiling the IRCT. The IRCT Resource Interface (IRCT-RI) provides a way of connecting the IRCT application to different resources for querying, and running processes. Some examples of resources are i2b2, i2b2/tranSMART, SciDB, and the ExAC browser.
