## Introduction
#### Purpose of this Document
This document will provide users with an understanding of how to interact with the Inter-Resource Communication Tool (IRCT). This includes an understanding of what the IRCT is, how to understand how to interact with resources it is connected to.

This document is broken into nine sections. The first section provides an overview
of the IRCT and dives into how a resource driven API, and individual components work.
We then provide a quick start where users can quickly write their first query against
the NHANES i2b2/tranSMART instance. We follow this up with an introduction into
security and interacting with secure resources. Then we explain more about resources,
and how users can understand what services, queries, and processes they support.
We follow this up by sections on searching for terms, writing queries, running processes,
and finally retrieving results in different formats. We wrap it all up with a section
on bringing it all together, how the IRCT can work for you, and some closing thoughts.

Since the IRCT is versioned we keep references to previous versions of the API in this document. Please check with your IRCT administrator to obtain your IRCT version.
