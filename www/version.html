			<div class="row moreRow">
			<p class="versionMaxRowHeader">Versions</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.3.1</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release includes an update to the documentation, as well as an update
				to the SciDB sql file.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.3</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release of the IRCT includes major updates to the query functionality.
				Queries can now support subqueries, and field values having both queries,
				and arrays. Queries also now fully support sort clauses, and select clauses
				can now have aggregates and other functions. This was accomplished by
				refactoring the query handling RESTFull service. This release also includes
				major improvements to the SciDB resource interface that allows for more
				complicated queries. Several minor bug fixes, and improvements were also
				included in this release.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.2.2</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release includes bug fixes that caused the IRCT to keep some files
				open which eventually caused the IRCT to consume more system resources then
				needed. It also includes fixes to the CSV result data converter, and the
				initial release of the SciDB resource interface. Other minor bug fixes and
				code improvements are included in this release.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.2.1</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release includes bug fixes in the logging of events, DB connection issues,
				and handling of system, and unkown URL HTTP requests.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.2</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release adds new search term functionality. Users can now perform more
				complicated searches for terms, as well as add listers to the terms that
				can expand upon the users initial searches. Initial new search extension
				listeners include capitalization of search tersm, as well as expanding the
				search with UMLS synonyms. Minor bug fixes, and improvements in the persistance
				are also included.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.1</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This release expands on the functionality of the IRCT by introducing event
				listeners. This allows for functionality to be added to individual deployments
				of the IRCT without having to make code changes to the core code. This new
				funcitonality exists in the extension repo (IRCT-EXT). The initial release
				includes event listeners that allow for monitoring, and the saving and retrieving of
				results from an AWS S3 bucket. The result data converters were also moved
				from the core code to the extensions repo as part of this refactoring.
				This release also includes updates to the resource interfaces for i2b2,
				and i2b2/tranSMART as well as some minor bug fixes in the RESTFull services.
				</aside>
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">1.0</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This is the first production release of the IRCT. It provides a resource
				driven RESTFull API that allows for a user to interact with several different
				resources from a single end point in a secure manner. Users can create secure
				sessions by creating, and using keys. It also includes resource interfaces
				for interacting with i2b2, i2b2/tranSMART, and ExAC.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">0.3</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This is a the second prerelease version of the IRCT. It contains several
				bug fixes that allow for better saving and retrieval of results.
			</p>

			<span class="versionRowHeader">0.2</span>
			<p class="versionText">
				This is the prerelease version of the IRCT that provides a proof of concept.
				It includes the first version of the resource interfaces for i2b2, i2b2/tranSMART,
				and the ExAC browser. It allows for basic queries, and processes to be
				performed across different resources of various types.
